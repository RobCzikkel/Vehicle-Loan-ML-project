<center> <h1> Vehicle Loan prediction with Machine Learning </h1> </center>

---
This is a portfolio project that intends to showcase my skills in using classification models from the scikit-learn Python library.
 <br>

The project consists of two parts:
+ a notebook with the wrangling and exploratory analysis<br>
    [*(Vehicle Loan Exploratory Analysis.ipynb)*](https://github.com/RobCzikkel/Vehicle-Loan-ML-project/blob/main/Vehicle%20Loan%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb)
+ another notebook with the ML models and their predictions<br>
    [*(Vehicle Loan ML models.ipynb)*](https://github.com/RobCzikkel/Vehicle-Loan-ML-project/blob/main/Vehicle%20Loan%20ML%20models.ipynb.ipynb)


___

<br>

**Models used for the predictions:**
1. K Nearest Neighbors
2. Decision Tree
3. Logistic Regression

<br>

**Libraries used:**
+ Matplotlib
+ Seaborn
+ Pandas
+ Numpy
+ scikit-learn 
+ imbalanced-learn
