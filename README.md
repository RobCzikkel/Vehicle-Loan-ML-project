<center> <h1> Vehicle Loan prediction with Machine Learning </h1> </center>

---
This is a portfolio project that intends to showcase my skills in using classification models from the scikit-learn Python library.
 <br>

The project consists of two parts:
+ a notebook with the wrangling and exploratory analysis<br>
    [*(Vehicle Loan Exploratory Analysis.ipynb)*](../blob/master/Vehicle-Loan-Exploratory-Analysis.ipynb)
+ another notebook with the ML models and their predictions<br>
    [*(Vehicle Loan ML models.ipynb)*](../blob/master/Vehicle-Loan-ML-models.ipynb)

___

<br>

**Models used for the predictions:**
1. K Nearest Neighbors
2. Decision Tree
3. Logistic Regression

<br>

**Libraries used:**
+ Matplotlib
+ Seaborn
+ Pandas
+ Numpy
+ scikit-learn
+ imbalanced-learn


<br>

The dataset has been download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/avikpaul4u/vehicle-loan-default-prediction)
